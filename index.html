            Yakuza 0 is an action-adventure game set in an open world
            environment and played from a third-person perspective. The game
            takes place from December 1988 to January 1989, in Kamurocho and
            Sōtenbori, fictionalized recreations of Tokyo's Kabukichō and
            Osaka's Dōtonbori areas respectively. The player controls series
            protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and recurring character Goro Majima,
            alternating between the two at predetermined points during the
            story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players can freely walk around Kamurocho and Sotenbori, interacting
            with people they meet to trigger side-quests, battling enemies who
            attack them on the street, or playing one of several minigames,
            including fully playable versions of Sega arcade games such as Out
            Run, Super Hang-On, Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone. Completing
            certain objectives, such as eating every dish at a restaurant or
            reaching a target score in a minigame, will also grant the player
            special Completion Point currency; these Completion Points can be
            spent at a shrine to receive additional bonuses, such as special
            items or character upgrades.

            The game was first announced in a special Yakuza event on 24 August
            2014, together with a trailer. A Chinese-language localization of
            the game was announced in 2014 and eventually released in Asia in
            May 2015. Shonan no Kaze performed the game's main theme and ending
            theme, "Bubble" and "Kurenai" respectively; these songs were not
            licensed for the English release and were instead replaced by
            original instrumental tracks.

          <p>
            On 5 December 2015, at PlayStation Experience in San Francisco, Sony
            Computer Entertainment's Gio Corsi announced that Yakuza 0 would be
            coming to the Americas for the PlayStation 4. Initially, no official
            confirmation was made of a European release. In July 2016, it was
            announced that the game would release in North America and Europe
            for the PlayStation 4 in January 2017.

          <p>
            Like the original game, Yakuza Kiwami is an action-adventure game
            with role-playing elements set in an open world environment and
            played from a third-person perspective. The player controls
            protagonist Kazuma Kiryu as he explores the streets of Kamurocho, a
            fictional district of Tokyo based on the real-life Kabukichō
            district. In addition to the main story, players will randomly
            encounter enemies on the street to battle, as well as meet people
            that will offer Kiryu side quests which can be completed for
            rewards.
          </p>

          <p>
            Similar to the prequel Yakuza 0, Kiwami features four fighting
            styles that the player can switch between in combat: the balanced
            Brawler style, the slow and heavy Beast style, the weak but quick
            Rush style, and Kiryu's traditional Dragon style. Players will earn
            both money and experience points by defeating enemies or completing
            side quests. Experience points can be used to acquire upgrades for
            Kiryu such as new techniques or an extension to his health bar.
            Money can be spent to purchase equipment or healing items, or to
            play various minigames and side-activities such as gambling,
            karaoke, and the card battle game Mesuking. Completing certain
            objectives will also grant the player special Completion Point
            currency; this CP can be spent to receive additional bonuses, such
            as special items or character upgrades.
          </p>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Development</h3>
          <p>
            Writer Masayoshi Yokoyama stated that Sega had plans to develop
            Kiwami in 2015 with the company wishing gamers enjoy the first
            Yakuza game on more modern quality. However, they were busy during
            that time making the game Yakuza 0. Positive feedback to the prequel
            led to the making of Kiwami. The franchise's 10th anniversary and
            the engine used for Yakuza 0 also provided help according to
            Yokoyama. The gameplay was made to be as friendly as possible to
            newcomers with them being options to save the game's progress
            whenever they wanted. There were ideas in regards to changing the
            cast and recordings of the original games, but the staff felt it
            would not be an appealing remake if there were so many changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than make it look like a retro game retaining the elements
            from the original PlayStation 2 games, the gameplay was made similar
            to eight generation titles, most notably Yakuza 0. Therefore, the
            team had to face the challenge of understanding the quality of the
            graphics and audio they could produce with a next generation console
            in contrast to the original console, which left the team wondering
            if there were issues with different parts of the game like the way
            the original Yakuza camera worked. The new voice actors include
            Tomokazu Sugita (who plays Shinji), however, his characterization
            was left to keep faithful to his bond with Kiryu despite their
            different ranks. The story was further expanded to increase the
            length while adding new minigames. The fighting system was borrowed
            from Yakuza 0 with a focus on grinding. Similar to the such game,
            Yakuza Kiwami has strong depiction of violence, most notably in the
            Heat Action sequences the player can perform. Yokoyama stated they
            wanted to make them as intense as possible.

            Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a remake of Yakuza 2, and is an action-adventure
            game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person
            perspective. Similar to the previous remake title, Yakuza Kiwami,
            Kiwami 2 follows the same plot structure of Yakuza 2 while adding
            new gameplay features and enhancements from later titles, as well as
            new story elements to resolve confusing plot points in the original
            release and tie the game more closely to other titles in the series.
            The player controls series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu as they explore
            the fictional Japanese districts of Kamurocho, Tokyo and Sotenbori,
            Osaka. Combat is based on that previously seen in Yakuza 6. A new
            "Majima Saga" story scenario features recurring series anti-hero
            Goro Majima as a playable character. The Cabaret Club minigame from
            Yakuza 0 returns, as does the Clan Creator from Yakuza 6, bringing
            in New Japan Pro Wrestling stars Keiji Mutoh, Masahiro Chono, Riki
            Choshu, Genichiro Tenryu, and Tatsumi Fujinami.

            announced two days later alongside Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Yakuza
            Online, and Hokuto ga Gotoku. The game runs on the Dragon Engine
            which was previously used in Yakuza 6. Several characters were
            recast for the remake, including Hakuryu as Ryo Takashima, Houka
            Kinoshita as Wataru Kurahashi, Yuichi Kimura as Tsutomo Bessho, and
            Susumu Terajima as Jiro Kawara. The in-game arcade features playable
            versions of Virtua Fighter 2 and Virtual On.

            Daisuke Tomoda, CS1 Team (Sega CS R&D) the visual artist and lead
            character designer of the Yakuza series since the original game,
            partially unveiled the development of Yakuza 3 at the 2009 Game
            Tools & Middleware Forum seminar held in Tokyo on June 15. The
            character design of Yakuza 3 began shortly after the completion of
            Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan! in 2008 with a three-week project phase
            followed by eight months of production. In the end 110 characters
            with high polygon were created for use in cutscenes, along with 250
            minor characters who did not appear in said cutscenes. These
            characters were created by a 60-member team, with each team member
            producing a dozen characters. A total 360 characters were produced,
            using a "one person, one body" philosophy and a
            "three-days-per-body" target schedule. In comparison, the production
            of Yakuza took 10 months and had no more volume. The series'
            production pace had been one of annual releases since the original
            Yakuza was released in 2005. CS1 used this slogan to describe the
            game's graphics: "Not Reality but Real (リアリティではなくリアル,
            Riariti de wa naku riaru).
